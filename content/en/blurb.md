There is a man chasing his rogue coffee maker. There is a Japanese DJ who doesn’t talk. There is a galactic business that sells planets and a mysterious woman who seems to live in bookstores…

Each one of the 13 stories in “Man vs Machine” opens the door to a completely new world, leaving you with a desire to read everything at once by jumping from one universe to the next by the turn of a page.

Powered by exact observations of people and places, Martinson’s concise prose pulls the reader into action sequences, thoughtful characters and unusual occurrences. His imaginary worlds seem to exist just around the corner of our everyday lives, making you see your days with new eyes.
And while you are at it, find out how The Guide Michelin would rate a restaurant run by Satan himself.  <br>
